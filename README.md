### Hi, I‚Äôm Rahul

I‚Äôm a Senior Research Fellow at the [Indian Statistical Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/)‚Äôs [Physics and Applied Mathematics Unit](https://www.isical.ac.in/~pamu/) in Kolkata, India.
Being fascinated with "space" and all the big questions of life from an early age, I decided to devote my life to finding the answers I seek in the most logical way possible: Science! Choosing Cosmology as my primary area of interest, I am extremely passionate about computers and computation in general, with my life-long dream being the efficient and apt application of cutting-edge computational methods to the field of Cosmology, Astronomy and Astrophysics.

Please feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:rahul.shah.13.97@gmail.com) at any time if you would like to collaborate, or just simply discuss physics, computers or existence...
